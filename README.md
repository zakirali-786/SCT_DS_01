# Population Analysis of India

This repository contains a comprehensive **data analysis project** on the population of India based on state-wise and gender-wise data. The analysis provides insights into population distribution, gender ratio, urban-rural distribution, density, and other demographics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about all **States and Union Territories of India**, including:

- Total population (`Population[50]`)
- Male and Female population
- Difference between male and female population
- Sex ratio (females per 1000 males)
- Rural and Urban population
- Area in km²
- Population density (per km²)

The dataset was sourced from [India Census data](#) (you can add the source link here).

## Analysis Performed

1. **Population Analysis**
   - Total population of India
   - Top 5 most and least populous states
   - Population distribution across states

2. **Gender Analysis**
   - Comparison of male vs female population
   - States with highest and lowest sex ratio
   - Gender population difference visualization

3. **Urban vs Rural Analysis**
   - Total rural vs urban population
   - Percentage of rural and urban population per state
   - Most urbanized and most rural states

4. **Density and Area Analysis**
   - States with highest and lowest population density
   - Correlation between area and population
   - Scatter plots for density vs population

5. **Visualizations**
   - Bar charts for population, male/female, rural/urban distribution
   - Histogram for population distribution
   - Pie charts for gender and rural/urban split
   - Scatter plots for density vs population

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for step-by-step analysis
